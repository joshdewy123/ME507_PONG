# ME 507 - Ping Pong Ball Launcher

## Overview

This autonomous ping pong launcher is capable of both manual and automatic targeting and launching. It rotates about two axes to aim, detects objects using a TF-Luna LIDAR, and fires ping pong balls using dual flywheels. The system is built around a custom PCB featuring an STM32 microcontroller, motor drivers, and dedicated I2C lines.

The goal of this project was to create a functional and robust autonomous targeting system while designing and assembling most of the electronics and mechanical components from scratch.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Roadblocks and Debugging Challenges

### 1. **Motor Driver Output Failures**

**Issue:** Turret motor driver (DRV8251) failed to drive motors consistently.

**Cause:** Missing or insufficient bulk capacitance and improper IPROPI pin handling.  
**Fix:**

- Added 0.1 ¬µF and 4.7 ¬µF capacitors to stabilize power rails
- Pulled IPROPI to GND through a 1.5kŒ© resistor

### 2. **LIDAR Inconsistent I2C Behavior**

**Issue:** TF-Luna LIDAR would intermittently drop off the I2C bus.  
**Cause:** No pull-up resistors on SDA and SCL lines.  
**Fix:** Manually added 10kŒ© pull-ups from both lines to 3.3V.

## üß† Software & Control Strategy

- **Main Loop FSM**: Manages launcher states (initialize, idle, move, scan, fire)
- **Manual Mode**: Accepts UART commands like `T1XX`, `M2XX`, `FIRE`, etc.
- **Auto Mode**: Scans with turret, stores LIDAR readings, picks closest target
- **IMU Mode**: Streams heading data (future FSM integration planned)

**FSM States Include:**

- `STATE_0`: Initialize
- `STATE_1`: Idle/Wait
- `STATE_2`: Move Turret
- `STATE_3`: Read LIDAR
- `STATE_4`: Spin Flywheels
- `STATE_5`: Fire via Servo
- `STATE_6`: Autonomous Scan Mode

## üìà Future Work

- Use IMU feedback to correct turret drift
- Add computer vision for target recognition
- Replace UART shell with GUI or wireless input
